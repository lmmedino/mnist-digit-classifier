# MNIST Digit Classification

This repository contains a convolutional neural network (CNN) model for classifying handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. The model is built using PyTorch and incorporates various techniques to improve generalization and prevent overfitting, including dropout and L2 regularization. The MNIST dataset, as provided by PyTorch's standard dataset loader, consists of grayscale images where the digits are white and the background is black. This version of the dataset is widely used for benchmarking image classification models. Below are examples of the white digits on a black background as used in this implementation:

## Preprocessing Steps

### 1. Data Normalization
The MNIST dataset consists of grayscale images with pixel values ranging from 0 to 255. To normalize these images, we first scale the pixel values to the range [0,1] by dividing them by 255. Next, we further normalize the data by centering it around zero, mapping the pixel values to the interval [-1,1].

These normalization steps are essential for stabilizing the training process by reducing the risk of vanishing and exploding gradients, promoting faster convergence, and enabling the neural network to learn more effectively from the data.

### 2. Data Augmentation
To enhance the model's generalization, the following data augmentation techniques were applied:
- **Random Rotation:** Images were randomly rotated by up to 10 degrees, to simulate real world variation in handwritting.
- **Random Affine Transformations:** Applied slight translations to the images.

These augmentations were applied dynamically during training to reduce overfitting and increase the model's robustness. It's important to note that, in the context of handwritten digit recognition, some transformations are unsuitable. For instance, flipping a '5' vertically results in an image that no longer resembles the digit '5'.

### 3. Train-validation split
We divided the original training set into separate training and validation sets to monitor the model's performance on unseen data during training. This allows for early stopping and fine-tuning of hyperparameters based on the validation set's performance. This approach helps prevent overfitting and ensures that the model generalizes well to new data.

## Model Architecture

The model architecture is a deep convolutional neural network consisting of the following layers:

1. **Convolutional Layers:**
   - `conv1`: $(28 \times 28 \times 1)$ input to $(28 \times 28 \times 32)$ output
   - `conv2_1`: $(28 \times 28 \times 32)$ input to $(14 \times 14 \times 64)$ output
   - `conv2_2`:$(28 \times 28 \times 32)$ input to $(14 \times 14 \times 64)$ output
   - `conv3_1`: $(14 \times 14 \times 64)$ input to $(7 \times 7 \times 256)$ output
   - `conv3_2`: $(14 \times 14 \times 64)$ input to $(7 \times 7 \times 256)$ output

   The layers `conv3_1`and `conv3_2` are concatenated to produce a final output with dimension $7 \times 7 \times 512$.

2. **ReLU Activation Functions:**
   - After each layer, except the last output layer a **ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit)** activation function is applied. ReLU introduces non-linearity into the model,allowing it to learn more complex patterns and make better predictions. ReLU is computationally efficient and helps to mitigate the vanishing gradient problem.

3. **Max Pooling:**
   - Max pooling layers are used to reduce the spatial dimensions of the feature maps while retaining the most important features. In this model, max pooling is applied after certain convolutional layers.
   - This operation reduces the computational load in the subsequent layers and helps to make the network more invariant to small translations in the input.

4. **Fully Connected Layers:**
   - `fc1`: Input of size $7 \times 7 \times 512$ to output of 1000 units
   - `fc2`: 1000 units to 500 units
   - `fc3`: 500 units to 10 units (corresponding to the 10 digit classes)


## Optimizer and Loss Function

- **Optimizer:** The Adam optimizer was selected for its ability to dynamically adjust the learning rate for each parameter. This adaptability allows Adam to perform effectively even in scenarios with sparse gradients or noisy data, making it particularly beneficial for tasks like image classification. Additionally, its default parameters generally work well, reducing the need for extensive hyperparameter tuning.

- **Loss Function:** Cross-entropy loss was used as the criterion since it is the standard loss function for multi-class classification problems.

## Hyperparameters

- **Batch Size:** Set to 32, which provides a good balance between convergence speed and stability.
- **Learning Rate:** Set to 0.001, a standard starting point for Adam optimizer that generally performs well.
- **Patience for Early Stopping:** Set to 5 epochs, meaning training will stop if the validation loss does not improve for 5 consecutive epochs.
- **Epochs:** The model was trained for up to 10 epochs, but early stopping could terminate the training earlier.

## Results

The initial model implementation achieved an impressive test set accuracy of 99.2%, demonstrating excellent generalization to unseen images from the MNIST dataset. To further illustrate the model's performance, the following metrics are presented: a confusion matrix, overall accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, along with per-class precision, recall, and F1-score. These metrics will provide a comprehensive view of how well the model performs across different classes.

</p>

</p>

The model's per-class performance is excellent, which suggests that it is generalizing well to unseen data from the test set. This strong performance across all classes is an indicator that the model is not overfitting.
## Improvements

### 1. **Dropout**
Despite the model's excellent performance with a test accuracy of 99.2%, dropout was implemented in the fully connected layers as an improvement to minimize overfitting and potentially further increase performance. Dropout randomly sets a fraction of the input units to zero during training, ensuring that the network doesn't rely too heavily on any individual neuron, thereby promoting robust generalization.

### 2. **L2 Regularization**
In addition to Dropout, L2 regularization was applied through the `weight_decay` parameter in the Adam optimizer. This technique penalizes large weights, encouraging the model to learn simpler patterns that generalize better to unseen data."

These enhancements, including Dropout and L2 regularization, help the model generalize better and reduce overfitting, ultimately leading to improved performance on the test set.

test_params:
  batch_size: 64

results_params:
  results_path: './results'

```

### Training

To train the model, run the following command:

```bash
python main.py --mode train
```
This command will
- Train the model using the configurations specified in the `config.yaml` file.
- Save the model to the models/ directory at the end of an epoch if the accuracy improves compared to previous epochs.
- Save the learning curves to the `results/` directory.
- Log the training process to `training.log`

### Testing

Once the model is trained, you can test it by running:

```bash
python main.py --mode test --model_path models/model_name.pth
